# SuperNEMO Summer Project

Repository for the code used in the Summer Project with the University of Edinburgh:

**Improving the vertical reconstruction of electron tracks in the commissioning data**

The Jupyter Notebook is meant to be used with the ROOT ntuple files for the different runs of the SuperNEMO Demonstrator Module;
in particular the file was created with each run file contained in a separate directory named after the run number.

To illustrate: 

'.../<directory with Juypter file>/<RUN NUMBER>/<ROOT file and other directories for plots, data or files>'
